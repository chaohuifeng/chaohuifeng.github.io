# üë®‚Äçüéì About Me

## üéØ Personal Overview

I'm **Chaohui Feng**, a passionate researcher specializing in earthquake simulation and cascading geo-hazards. Currently working as a Research Assistant at the National Institute of Natural Hazards (MEMC-CAS), I focus on developing computational methods to understand and predict natural disasters.

My research journey began with land consolidation engineering and has evolved into advanced seismic modeling, driven by a desire to contribute to disaster risk reduction and community resilience.
